# EmulationStation Theme: (New) Eudora Bigshot

## About this theme

Eudora is a clean theme that displays both large preview images and
all title-oriented metadata. In the base theme, both portrait and
landscape image layouts are used in order to best fit the preview
images for a variety of systems. 

Eudora Bigshot omits all metadata and uses a single layout with a
large preview image. 


## About this fork

I forked this theme because it's discontinued and it's my favorite
because is clean and simple. For updating the Emulators I'm using them
from ES Carbon theme.

* Carbon theme: https://github.com/RetroPie/es-theme-carbon
