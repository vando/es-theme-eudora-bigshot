# EmulationStation Theme: (New) Eudora Bigshot

## About this theme

Eudora is a clean theme that displays both large preview images and
all title-oriented metadata. In the base theme, both portrait and
landscape image layouts are used in order to best fit the preview
images for a variety of systems. 

Eudora Bigshot omits all metadata and uses a single layout with a
large preview image. 


## Why this fork

I forked this theme because it's discontinued.
